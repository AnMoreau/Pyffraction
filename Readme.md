# Pyffraction !

Pyffraction is a very simple code to compute diffraction images. For now, only the diffraction figure of holes with a diameter $D$ that are regularly spaced on concentric circles. This figures are simply very nice to watch, but so different from each other that you may want to try yourself ! 

Just download the `Pyffraction.py` (ridiculous, right ?) and run it ! There is an example included, and you can modify the code.
